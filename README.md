<summary>⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that Nike was not the favourite name among all potential names when Philip Knight (founder of Nike) was starting to produce his own shoes (he used to be a distributor for many years before this happened)? Do you know what Nike was actually supposed to be called, hehe? </summary>
<br>
Among all options, "Dimension Six" was offered by the founder himself. Other employees of Blue Ribbon Sports (Knight's distribution business) thought perhaps for his love of the pop group The 5th Dimension. Then, they also considered to follow the footsteps of a German powerhouse - Puma, and suggested "Peregrine" & "Bengal". One of the employees of Blue Ribbon (Mr. Johnson) also pointed out that successful brand names had no more than two syllables and at least one exotic letter or sound in them with a Z, X or K. He was also the one to suggest Nike. 
It appeared as if nobody liked any of the options. But due to them being on crunch of time, Knight made a choice to go with Nike and said the following: "I don’t like any of them, but I guess that’s the best of the bunch. I hope it grows on me.”
